This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Focus on high-impact moments.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Add contextual effects and textures. Gradient meshes, noise textures, decorative borders.

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families, cliched color schemes, and Predictable layouts.
